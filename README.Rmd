# Welcome to RECON's drat repository

This `drat` repository can be used for installing devel versions of RECON
packages automatically pointing to the relevant branch, typically `@release`. You will first need to install `drat`, which you can do within R using:

```
install.packages("drat")
```

Then to install development version of our packages, e.g. the `nomad` package
here, you can type:

```
drat:::add("reconhub")
install.packages("nomad")
```

Note that the first line `drat::add("reconhub")` can be added to your
`.Rprofile`, in which case whenever you install RECON packages, the current
devel version will be used.
